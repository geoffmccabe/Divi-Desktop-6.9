//! # DMT — Divi Meta Tokens, reference indexer
//!
//! Normative implementation of `docs/DMT-TOKENS-SPEC.md`. Where this code and
//! the specification disagree, **this code is authoritative** and the document
//! is amended to match (spec §9.5) — one normative implementation is how two
//! indexers are kept from quietly believing different things.
//!
//! ## What this is
//!
//! DMT is an **overlay**. The Divi chain carries and orders these records
//! permanently; this software interprets them into balances. The network does
//! not validate token rules and no opcode could make it (spec §2, §12.2). The
//! accurate claim is "permanently recorded and ordered by the Divi chain",
//! never "the network enforces it".
//!
//! ## Two rules that shape everything here
//!
//! **Ignore, never destroy.** Any malformed, unparsable or unrecognised record
//! is skipped with no state change at all. The only record that ever destroys
//! units is an explicit BURN. This is a deliberate rejection of Runes'
//! "cenotaph" design, where a malformed record burns every token in the
//! transaction and an unrecognised field destroys the holdings of anyone
//! running older software (spec §8).
//!
//! **Halt rather than diverge.** An envelope version this build cannot read
//! stops the indexer instead of guessing. An indexer that stops and asks to be
//! upgraded is *unavailable*, which is recoverable. Two indexers that silently
//! disagree is *divergence*, which is not.
//!
//! ## Layout
//!
//! The envelope, varints, addresses and object ids live in `dvxp-core`, shared
//! with PoE and NFD. This crate owns only what is specific to tokens:
//!
//! | module | role |
//! |---|---|
//! | [`ticker`] | charset, length, normalised reserved matching |
//! | [`fees`] | compiled-in fee constants, scaled by ticker length |
//! | [`record`] | the eight record types and subtype dispatch |
//!
//! Adding a new record type is a local change — see [`record`].
