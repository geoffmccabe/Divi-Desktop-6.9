//! A per-epoch Merkle commitment to who owns which collectible.
//!
//! ## What this is for, and what it is not
//!
//! A transaction inclusion proof shows that a record is **in a block**. It does
//! not show that the record **did anything**. A malformed NFD record, or one
//! sent by somebody who did not own the collectible, is still in the block and
//! still provably included; only the overlay rules decide whether ownership
//! actually moved.
//!
//! So a chain that wants to know who owns a collectible has two options: run its
//! own overlay indexer, or be handed a commitment to the interpreted result.
//! This is the second. Each epoch produces one 32-byte root, and any individual
//! collectible can then be proven against it with a proof of about
//! `log2(n) * 32` bytes.
//!
//! **The root is a commitment, not an oracle.** It says "an indexer that
//! followed these rules got this answer". Its trustworthiness is entirely the
//! trustworthiness of whoever signs and publishes it, which today is one key and
//! is therefore no better than a coordinator's signature. The format is what is
//! being fixed now; the signer is a separate question and a later one.
//!
//! ## Deliberately not mirrored state
//!
//! One root per epoch, and proofs on demand. The alternative, copying the
//! registry onto another chain, costs storage forever for every collectible
//! including the overwhelming majority nobody ever bridges, and it goes stale
//! between updates. A stale copy of *ownership* is the specific failure worth
//! avoiding: it is what lets somebody trade against an owner who has already
//! moved on.
//!
//! ## Two details a Solidity verifier must match byte for byte
//!
//! **Domain separation.** Leaves are hashed with a `0x00` prefix and internal
//! nodes with `0x01`. Without it, an attacker can present an internal node as if
//! it were a leaf, because both are just 32 bytes, and prove membership of
//! something that was never in the tree.
//!
//! **No duplicated odd node.** The usual trick for an odd row is to hash the
//! last node with itself. That is the flaw behind Bitcoin's CVE-2012-2459: two
//! different trees produce the same root, so a root no longer identifies one set.
//! Here an odd node is **promoted unchanged** to the next row instead, which has
//! no such ambiguity.
//!
//! Leaves are also **sorted and de-duplicated** before the tree is built, so the
//! root depends on the set and not on the order an indexer happened to walk it.
