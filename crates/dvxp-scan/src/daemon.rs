//! The overlay indexer daemon: catch up, follow the tip, serve the read API.
//!
//! Catches up from the genesis height, then follows the tip for as long as it
//! runs, rolling back and re-applying when the chain reorganises, and serving
//! the read API the whole time.
//!
//! Its predecessor scanned once and exited, which was enough to prove the
//! parsers worked and not enough to run anything: a restart rescanned from
//! zero, a reorg silently left the wrong answer in place, and nothing throttled
//! the node.
//!
//! Configuration is entirely environment variables, because this runs as a
//! service next to a node and a config file is one more thing to get out of
//! sync with the unit file:
//!
//! ```text
//! DIVI_RPC_URL     default http://127.0.0.1:51473/
//! DIVI_RPC_USER    required
//! DIVI_RPC_PASS    required
//! START_HEIGHT     genesis height for the overlay (default 0)
//! SNAPSHOT         where to publish progress (default /var/lib/divi-scan/overlay.json)
//! API_BIND         read API address (default 127.0.0.1:8710, empty disables it)
//! POLL_SECONDS     how often to look for a new block (default 20)
//! RPC_GAP_MICROS   minimum gap between RPC calls (default 4000, about 250/sec)
//! SNAPSHOT_EVERY   blocks between snapshot writes while catching up (default 5000)
//! ALLOW_PLACEHOLDER_TREASURY=1   run with the treasury unset (regtest only)
//! ```
